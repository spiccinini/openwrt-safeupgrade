define Package/$(PKG_NAME)/description
	$(PKG_NAME) provides safe firmware upgrades using two partitions with a
	confirmation  step. When the new firmware boots it must be confirmed with
	'$(PKG_NAME) confirm' before  a defined period of time. If confirmation is not
	done, because you don't like the new  firmware or the firmware does not work
	(you can't reach the device, etc), the device is automatically  reverted to the
	previous state. This automatic revert is performed by the hardware watchdog  if
	the firmware crash before linux boots or in a linux userspace timer if the
	firmware boots  but you don't confirm it. The state of which firmware partition
	has to be booted and the logic that  allows booting a partition with rollback
	is implemented by a u-boot script that is installed  by '$(PKG_NAME) install'.
